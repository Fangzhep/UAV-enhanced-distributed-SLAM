# UAV-enhanced-distributed-SLAM
To develop a robust and scalable distributed SLAM framework that enables autonomous, collaborative exploration and 2D mapping of large-scale environments by leveraging aerial vehicles to assist ground robots beyond their LiDAR sensing range.

# Objectives
**(1)	Use feature-based map alignment and loop detection algorithms for real-time map merging in distributed SLAM systems. Apply distributed pose graph optimization to reduce computational overhead and communication costs.
**(2)	Develop a communication-efficient, parallel coordination framework where UAVs act as relay nodes to maintain connectivity and enable seamless information exchange among ground robots during exploration.
**(3)	Leverage aerial vehicles to aggregate environmental knowledge—particularly around hazardous or occluded areas—to support ground vehicle navigation and optimize route planning.
